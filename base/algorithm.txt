Goal: To make a bubble sort program with C
Input: An array of unsorted 9 numbers
Output: An array of sorted 9 numbers (using bubble sort)
Steps: 
- Make a function to simply print the values of the numbers in the array, printValues()
	- Use for loop by using the length of the array
	- Iterate each number in the array step by step

- Make a function to swap the two adjacent values if one is bigger than the other one, swap(int* a, int* b)
	- Swap the addresses by using a temporary variable
		- Let the placeholder be *a first.
		- Then,let *a get *b. Now, the value at b is at a.
		- Then,let *b get the value of placeholder.Thus, the value at b is now the old value of a.

- Make a function to sort the array in ascending order, sort()
	- Use nested loop since there will be two values (Meaning: there will be two loops)
		- The first for loop should use the length of the array, variable_name = i
		-  The second for loop should use (length of the array) minus one, variable_name = j
	- Use if conditional statement to determine if the two values need to be swapped or not.
		- If left value > right value, swap
			- If array[j] > array[j+1]
			- Call the swap function, swap(*array[j], *array[j+1])
	- Call printValues() function to see the result after each pass
