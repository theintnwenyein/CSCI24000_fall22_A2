Goal: To sort the given array with by using insertion sort technique
Input: Nothing since the array is already given
Output: The sorted array 
Steps:

- Include necessary header files

- Set the length of the array, length = 9

- Set a pre-defined array of length 9, int values[]

- Call the necessary function prototypes such as sort() and printValues()

- Build the main function to print the array before sorting and after sorting

- Create the function to sort the array in ascending order, sort()
 
	- Use for loop by setting the second element of the array as the starting point

	- Make necessary adjustments by creating a temporary variable to be able to switch the values

	- Use while loop to determine when and how the switch occurs

	- Use printValues() to see the result after each pass

- Create a simple function to print the value of each element in the array

	- Use for loop by starting at the 0th position, stopping at the last element while the behavior is increment
